        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>
            My hobbies are playing basketball, taking pictures of whatever I want, and editing too.<br>
            I always eat when I'm in the right mood, and I always listen to music, but I base the genre of the music on my mood.<br>
            I don't know, I'm just like that. I like posting pictures on Instagram; to be honest, I have 2 accounts, but I don't usually post pictures;<br>
            I only post when I have a good picture, and I also like thrifting clothes. Thrifting is my therapy;<br>
            I would rather spend money on thrift clothes than expensive clothes. I like to go out with my friends or just myself.<br>
            I like walking when it's not hot. And I go to the gym three times a week because I want a healthy body and aesthetic body.
